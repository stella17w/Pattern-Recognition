Purpose: Compare Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-nearest neighbor, and K-Means Clustering on their accuracy in detecting data anomalies in the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark artificial dataset.

Description: I compared different data window sizes and tested these algorithms on their accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, false positives, and false negatives on detecting outliers and tested on detecting differences in waveform patterns. Here are the results from this code:
